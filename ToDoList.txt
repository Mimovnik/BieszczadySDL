Refactor of ALL CODE (it's garbage):
-main is tooooooooo looooooooooong
-screen should be member of Display class
-almost every class have only public members and functions- need to privatize and protect some of them
-using pointer where references are enough
-physics are not right- mixing acceleration with force, reseting all forces every frame and reapplying them again
-using realTime instead of gameTime in various places- need to consider changing it to gameTime
Features:
-Block item drops when destroyed
-Equipment inventory
Bugs:
-when acceleration is to big player sinks into terrain then blocks itself in it
-when fullscreenMode is on the cursor is misplaced and player sinks into terrain
-when moving a game window player sometimes teleports (only on Windows)
